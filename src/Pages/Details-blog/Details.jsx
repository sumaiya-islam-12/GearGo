                  <li>. Battery backup of at least 4 hours(standard) to support normal operations of the vehicle.</li>
                  <li>. Emergency Buttons must be included in the vehicle which sends information such as location details to a specified IP Address or in case there is no GPRS connectivity send an SMS.</li>
                  <li>. An embedded SIM is also a suggestion in this protocol.</li>
                  <li>. Device must be resistant to dust, temperature, vibration, water splash (with minimum IP 65rating) and tamper-proof.</li>
