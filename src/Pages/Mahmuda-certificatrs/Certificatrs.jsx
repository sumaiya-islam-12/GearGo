        GPS Tracking devices have to be approved by NTA (Nepal Telecommunications Authority) for it saftey and standard for use in Nepal. All Devices that are not TYPE Approved by NTA cannot be guaranteed for its safety and standard and it is illegal according to Nepalâ€™s law.

        Having GPS tracking devices TYPE APPROVED by NTA alone does not mean that one can operate and sell those devices in Nepal. The Ministry of Information and Communications (MOIC) have to give licence in this regard.
